# Hamburger Head Lens

This directory previously contained a complete lens project. Due to repository size constraints, binary assets have been removed.

To recreate the effect, open the Paper Head template in Lens Studio and replace the head texture with your own burger image. A public domain burger photo can be found on [Openverse](https://wordpress.org/openverse/).
